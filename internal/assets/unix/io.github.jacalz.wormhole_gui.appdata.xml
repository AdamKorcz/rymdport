    <p>
      Wormhole-gui is a cross-platform application that lets you easily share files, folders and text between devices. It uses the Go implementation of magic-wormhole, called wormhole-william, and compiles statically into a single binary. Wormhole-gui is also compatible with sending to and receiving from other wormhole clients, such as the cli applications from both wormhole-william and magic-wormhole.
